Data Visualizations and Storytelling

1. Start With the Big Picture – KPI Cards
Chart Used: KPI Cards (Total Price, Total Quantity, Total Cost, Total Revenue, Total Profit)
My dashboard begins with KPI Cards that quickly tell the overall business performance.
We can see the Total Price = 9M, Total Quantity = 268K, Total Cost = 10M, Total Revenue = 9M, and Total Profit = 8M.
These KPIs help us understand the company’s financial health in just one.

 2. Show Seasonal Trends – Profit by Month
Chart Used: Pie Chart (Profit by Month)
The Pie Chart helps us understand how profit is distributed across months.
Months like January, March, and May have higher profit, while June and July have lower profit.
This chart tells a story of seasonal performance and helps in planning marketing campaigns.

 3. Highlight Geographic Performance – Profit by State
Chart Used: Bar Chart (Total Profit by State)
The Bar Chart clearly shows which states contribute most to our profit.
California and England are top-performing states, while others show lesser profit.
This helps us identify strong markets and where additional support is needed.

4. Compare Products – Profit by Product Category
Chart Used: Column Chart (Total Profit by Product Category)
The Column Chart compares different product categories.
Categories like Chairs and Bookcases generate the highest profit, while others perform less.
This helps the business decide which products to promote or redesign.

 5. Explore Financial Trends Over Time – Cost, Revenue & Profit
Chart Used: Clustered Column Chart (Total Cost, Total Profit, Total Revenue by Month)
The Clustered Column Chart shows the relationship between Cost, Revenue, and Profit every month.
We can see how revenue increases or decreases each month, how cost changes, and how profit is impacted.
This chart helps us understand financial trends clearly.

6. Highlight Global Insights – Revenue by Country
Chart Used: Pie Chart (Total Revenue by Country)
The Pie Chart for Revenue by Country shows the contribution from different regions.
The United States gives the highest revenue, followed by Australia, Germany, and France.
This helps the company understand where international performance is strongest.
